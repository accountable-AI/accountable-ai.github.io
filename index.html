<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Module description</h1>
		<p>This course will provide students with interdisciplinary approaches to understand the social and ethical effects of the ubiquitous deployment of AI technology and Machine Learning. This includes (but is not limited to) biases in data processing, surveillance, privacy, misrepresentation, and recourse. Machine Learning and AI systems seem to generate “automated decisions”, but people are central at every step of the lifecycle: defining tasks, generating datasets, preprocessing and labelling, which models to use, what to optimize, and so on. We will engage with the socio-technical nature of these issues in order to think through the needs for accountable and human-centered AI. We also critically investigate the regimes of knowledge in computer science when dealing with AI accountability.
		<br>					
		We will start with contemporary and intersectional foundations in ethics, and then move to the current and growing research literature on ethics in AI, before considering specific AI tasks, data sets and methodologies through the lens of the ethical considerations identified. The weekly discussions are grounded in the implementation of AI in “data life”: the everyday interactions of citizens with predictive AI technology and big data. In doing so, students will become acquainted with different perspectives on AI accountability. This incudes ethical orientations towards accountability, legal frameworks for AI implementation, and computational methods for fairness and transparency.
		<br>	
		Students will learn to formulate an interdisciplinary perspective on AI through multiple theoretical frameworks grounded in technical and humanistic perspectives, and to construct and explain logical arguments about AI in relation to significant issues in studies of technology, data ethics, literature, culture, and society. The course will feature guest lecturers from different disciplinary backgrounds to ensure a diversity of standpoints, voices and concerns</p>
